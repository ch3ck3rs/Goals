This week I would like to accomplish what.... Digital Pillar MO,
Digital Pillar Eng, Standards, Data Centers, Joy

Digital Pillar MO - I need to get a better grip on what
we are doing next for MO Digital Pillar.  Finish up the summary of we have learned.
Make sure the wednesday email is ready to go.  Read the Business Priority report and
start to game plan.  What questions have we not asked?

    What kind of training is needed for the team?  Just PowerBI/SharePoint,
    app specific training for an internal tool, 3DTrasar/enVision/Ecolab3D
    complaint is that most of the training is geared towards the sales team - what
    other information are they missing?

Standards - start marking up the drawings for the CLX 4" ROs

Data Centers - fill out the summary of analysis.  Add Ryan's comments about setting
a standard for the data centers group.  He see's no point on agreeing to a specific
lead time for custom jobs just for data Centers.  Jacob add this to the deck along
with the previous analysis you have done

Joy - documents to upload and training for thursday

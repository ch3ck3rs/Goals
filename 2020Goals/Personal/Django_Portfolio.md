# Create Django Portfolio

---


### Goal: Create Django Portfolio to replace the use of GitHub Pages for goals and weekly log

Why:

*  links are manual and suck
*  Not easy to do blog and goals and log

Progress:

*  Basic Portfolio up and running

Thoughts:

* would like to be able to continue editing in local txt editor and the push to source?


Challenges:

* how to upload markdown? [Use GitHub API?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23031406/how-do-i-implement-markdown-in-django-1-6-app)   -  
[or maybe this](https://github.com/pioneers/website/wiki/Using-Markdown-To-Write-Blog-Posts)

        Why:

        *  links are manual and suck
        *  Not easy to do blog and goals and log

        Progress:

        - [x] Basic Portfolio up and running
        - [x] create API to upload a 'job' to portfolio-project
        - [ ] host on digital ocean
        - [ ] Map out Goals in Life-Project

          - Home - what is most important? Goals? Blog? wkl log?
          - What happens when you click on a category?

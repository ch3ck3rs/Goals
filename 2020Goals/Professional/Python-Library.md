# Broader understanding of the Python Library

----------

### Goal: Learn and use one new Python Library each month

Why:
 
* to break out of Pandas
* Python libraries are extremely specialized and designed to do one task very well.  It can be more efficient to use multiple libraries to complete a task than to 'make it work' in one library.
* More libraries : More possibilities  

Progress:

*

##### How to find new and useful Libraries

# Create Django Portfolio

---


### Goal: Create Django Portfolio to replace the use of GitHub Pages for goals and weekly log

Why:

*  links are manual and suck
*  Not easy to do blog and goals and log

Progress:

- [x] Basic Portfolio up and running
- [x] create API to upload a 'job' to portfolio-project
- [ ] host on digital ocean
- [ ] Map out Goals in Life-Project


Thoughts:


Challenges:

Resolved:

~~would like to be able to continue editing in local txt editor and the push to source?~~ API

how to upload markdown? [ simple blog to add markdown flavor ](https://www.imzjy.com/blog/2018-05-20-render-the-markdown-in-django)
consider upgrading to github api return

[theme for blog](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/suppablog/)

----------

##### Monthly Focus:

* January
  - make any website

* February
    - outline Goals App
    - host on Digital Ocean

---

##### How to achieve goal (WIP)

* Goals App
  - What Fields do I want to record?
    - ! add Category field?
    - Specific fields for easy recovery?
    - General text field for more flexibility
* How Well does theme fit?

* Flow through site
  - Home - What is most important? Goals?
    - pin most important?
    - pin recently edited?
    - one per category?
  - If you click on a category:
    - landing page that pulls all goals who match that category, ranked by mod date
    - Use about page: header will be category description
    - pull container from 'about' page and use for loop to display goals


## Outcome

Task * Purpose * Example of Use * Outcome

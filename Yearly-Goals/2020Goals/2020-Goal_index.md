# 2020 Goals
Goal Tracker for Professional and Personal Growth Goals

## Review

2020 was the year of the pandemic.  It was a very strange year that has set many new standards around the world.  We now wear masks everywhere we go.  Many small companies have converted to 100% remote work.  We, at Ecolab, will not return to office til July 2021, though this could change again.

# The pitty party ends now

Alright, it ends today.  I'm done moping, it's not like he moved away forever.
Yes, the bed is cold at night, and I don't get see his goofy dancing as he 
makes dinner, but it's time to get over it.  It's only six weeks.  We just did
two years.

**Vice** - drowing my thoughts with audio books and not getting sleep
**Stop Gap** 
- No more audio books in the bedroom.  Podcasts like news and PyBytes
are ok.
- No more audio books unless I am doing another task like cooking or knitting

**Vice** - lack of sense of acomplishment
**Stop Gap** - first thing at work and when I get home, do one small thing on 
to-do list

**Vice** - lack of give-a-fucks
**Stop Gap** - work the plan, don't listen to the voice that says 'who cares anyway'
- make Jocko your wakeup call

Yes this sucks.  Yes it's easier to just not care.  Yes, 'no one could blame you'. 
Being sad is not an excuse. Get After It.

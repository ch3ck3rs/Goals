And we're moving... 

We found out 6 weeks ago that Nathan will be relocated to a location in a different state.  Since then it has been one whirl wind after another.  The first is all of the uncertainty of what location will he go to, will I be able to keep my role, what is the timing, what needs to be closed out and wrapped up, and so on.


What does life look like today.  As January draws to a close, life looks crazy.  We sit here on Wednesday Jan 29th, two days before the close of the month.  On Monday Nathan will leave for training in SC to return on Thursday.  Then a weekend on the town with friends Saturday Night onto Sunday, and when that draws to a close he takes a one way trip to Asheville.  

Then comes Monday.  He will officially start his new role and take ownership of our new apartment.  We will both start the first week of classes for our masters.  And in case that wasn't enough, we still have to move the household, sell my car and buy me a new one.  Oh.. and set up a home office for me, because I'll be working from home... and that is also finals week.

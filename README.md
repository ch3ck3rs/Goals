Goal Tracker for Professional and Personal Growth Goals

## On GitHub ##

### This ReadMe.md ###

Shall define what information should be kept in this repo, where said information is to be stored, the process for updating information, and the process for commenting on information. 

### The Repo ###
Shall contain this readme and copies of any local files necessary for completion of the goal.  Such as excel sheets, word docs, OneNote Journals, and archives of blog posts.

### The Project Boards ###
One project should be created for each year's goals.

The left most column, should contain a list of each goal to be achieved ranked by priority.

There should be a column for each goal.  These columns should contain one time actions that need to be completed prior to working on the goal or before work can be completed.  They should NOT contain the tasks needed for the goal.
 
	i.e. 
		should conatin 'find a blog that reviews python libraries'
		should NOT contain 'read blog every week'  

### The Wiki ###
Should contain the meat of the goals.  

* Goal Statement
* Why the goal is important
* How to achieve the goal
* Progress and Outcomes 

The Wiki should also contain any major learnings, pitfalls and reprioritizations.
